# ORM-REST Module

Flavor of Kohana ORM supporting REST.

## Getting Started

Setup a [Dispatch](https://github.com/morgan/kohana-dispatch) connection. Models use the "default" 
connection by default which can be changed by setting the `_connection_name` property.

Once a connection is setup, simply create a model:

	class Model_Example extends ORM_REST {}
